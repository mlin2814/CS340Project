# CS340Project
The repo that will hold our project for OSU CS340.

We have a main page that will have two scrollable sections: one for all of the teachers in the school and the other for all of the students.

There will be a teacher page that will contain a scrollable section for all of the teachers in the school and two forms, one to add a new teacher and another to update an existing teacher's information. Next to the teachers' name will be a DELETE button. When you select the DELETE button, a popup will ask to confirm. The ADD and UPDATE forms will be nearly identical, except the UPDATE form will have the additional field of the teacher's ID to ensure the administrator has the correct teacher they would like to update.

There will be a student page very much like the teacher page that will contain a scrollable section for all of the students in the school and two forms, one to add a new student and another to update an existing student's information. Next to the students' name will be a DELETE button. When you select the DELETE button, a popup will ask to confirm. The ADD and UPDATE forms will be nearly identical, except the UPDATE form will have the additional field of the student's ID to ensure the administrator has the correct student they would like to update.

There will be a textbook page that will have two sections: a scrollable student roster and a textbook form. When a student is selected, the form will populate with the textbook information the student is associated with. From there, an administrator can update or add a textbook for the student. The form will either have information filled in based on if the student has a textbook associated with them or not, and two buttons at the bottom: ADD/UPDATE and DELETE.
